### 📖 What I Learned

1. **Cloud Computing Fundamentals**

   - Introduction - history of AWS [In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web services—now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace upfront capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. ]
   - What is cloud computing - Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
   **Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the internet.
   - Six advantages of cloud computing: Trade capital expense for variable expense, Benefit from massive economies of scale, Stop guessing capacity, Increase speed and agility, Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers, Go global in minutes
   - Deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid clouds
   - Cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

2. **AWS Global Infrastructure**

   - Regions: Geographic areas (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1)
   - Availability Zones: Isolated locations within regions
   - Edge Locations: Points of presence for CloudFront

3. **GitHub for Learning Documentation**

   - Created structured repository for DevOps journey
   - Set up progress tracking with README.md
   - Organized monthly learning paths

### 💻 Hands-on Practice
```bash
# Created GitHub repository structure
mkdir -p 01-cloud-foundations/{study-notes,code-labs,cheatsheets}
mkdir -p projects/month1-static-website

# AWS CLI setup (if done)
aws configure 
for first account(A): aws sts get-caller-identity --profile practice (Niikky_Techies)
for second account(B): aws sts get-caller-identity --profile learning (nikko)
