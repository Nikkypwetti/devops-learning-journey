### 📖 What I Learned

1. **EC2 INSTANCE TYPES - OVERVIEW**

   - You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimized for different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

   - AWS has the following naming convention:

      m5.2xlarge:

      . m: instance class
      . 5: generation(AWS improves them over time)
      . 2xlarge: size within the instance class


2. **EC2 INSTANCE TYPES - GENERAL PURPOSE**

   - Great for a diversity of a workloads such as web servers or code repositories

   - Balance Between:
     . Compute
     . Memory
     . Networking

   - We'll be using general purpose instances. We'll be using the t2.micro, which is the free tier general purpose type of instance.

3. **EC2 INSTANCE TYPES - COMPUTE OPTIMIZED**

   - Great for compute an intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
     . Batch processing some data(workloads).
     . Media transcoding.
     . High performance web servers.
     . high performance computing (HPC).
     . Scientific Modeling & Machine Learning.
     . Dedicated Gaming Server.

   - So in terms of the names for the memory optimized instances, that's going to be the C series.

4. **EC2 INSTANCE TYPES - MEMORY OPTIMIZED**

   - Fast performance for workloads that process large data set in memory.

   - Use cases:
     . High performance for relational or non-relational databases
     . Distributed web scale cache store. So for ElastiCache, for example.
     . In memory databases that are optimized for business intelligence (BI).
     . Applications performing realtime processing of big unstructured data.

   - So in terms of the names for the memory optimized instances, that's going to be the R series because R stands for RAM. But there's also going to be X1, High Memory and Z1.

5. **EC2 INSTANCE TYPES - STORAGE OPTIMIZED**

   - Great for storage intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage

   - Use cases:
     . high frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
     . Relational and NoSQL databases.
     . Cache for in-memory databases (for example Redis).
     . Data warehousing applications.
     . Distributed file system.

   - storage optimized instances in AWS. We'll start with a I or D or H1.

6. **EC2 INSTANCE TYPES - EXAMPLE**

   - A website to compare all the instances together, there's one that I really like. It's called ec2instances.info.

7. **INTRODUCTION TO SECURITY GROUPS**

   - Security groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS.

   - They control how traffic are allow in and out of our EC2 instances

    [ So here, let's take an example. We are on our computer, so we are on the public internet, and we're trying to access our EC2 instance from our computer. We are going to create a security group around our EC2 instance, that is the firewall that is around it ].

    [ And then this security group is going to have rules. And these rules are going to say whether or not some inbound traffic, so from the outside into the EC2 instance is allowed ].

    [ And also if the EC2 instance can perform some outbound traffic, so to talk from where it is into the internet ].

   - Security Groups only contain allow rules
   - Security Groups rules can reference by IP or by security groups

   **Security Groups**

   - Deeper Dive
     . Security groups are acting as"Firewall" on EC2 instances.

     - They Regulates:
       . Access to ports
       . Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6 (Two types of IP on the internet)
       . Control of Inbound Network (From other to instances)
       . Control of Outbound Network (From instance to other)

     - And when we look at security group rules, they will look just like this. So there will be the type, the protocol, so TCP, the port allowing it, so where the traffic can go through on the instance, and the source, which represents an IP address range. And 0.0.0.0/0 means everything. And this here means just one IP.

   - Diagram:
     . So we have our EC2 instance, and it has one security group attached to it that has inbound rules and outbound rules, so I've separated them onto this diagram. So our computer is going to be authorized on, say, port 22, so the traffic can go through from our computer to the EC2 instance. But someone else's computer that's not using my IP address because they don't live where I live, then if they try to access our EC2 instance, they will not get through it because the firewall is going to block it, and it will be a timeout.

     . Then for the outbound rules, by default, our EC2 instance for any security group is going to be by default allowing any traffic out of it. So our EC2 instance, if it tries to access a website and initiate a connection, it is going to be allowed by the security group. So this is the basics of how the firewall works.

   - Good To Know:
     . Can be attached to multiple instances
     . Locked down to a region or VPC combination ( So if you switch to another region, you have to create a new security group, or if you create another VPC ).
     . Don't live "Outside" the EC2 - If traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it.
     . It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
     . If your application is not accessible (Timeout), then it's a security group issue.
     . If your application gives a "Connection Refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched.
     . By default, all inbound traffic is blocked.
     . All outbound traffic is authorized.

   - Referencing Other Security Group
     - Diagram:
       . [ how to reference security groups from other security groups. So let me explain things. So we have an EC2 instance, and it has a security group, what I call group number one. And the inbound rules is basically saying, I'm authorizing security group number one inbound and security group number two. So why would we even do this? Well, if we launch another EC2 instance and it has security group two attached to it, well, by using the security group run rule that we just set up, we basically allow our EC2 instance to go connect straight through on the port we decided onto our first EC2 instance. Similarly, if we have another EC2 instance with a security group one attached well, we've also authorized this one to communicate straight back to our instances. And so regardless of the IP of our EC2 instances, because they have the right security group attached to them, they're able to communicate straight through to other instances. And that's awesome because it doesn't make you think about IPs all the time ].

8. **CLASSIC PORTS TO KNOW**

   - 22 = SSH(Secure Shell) - Log into a linux instance.
   - 21 = FTP(File Transfer Protocol) - Upload files into a file share.
   - 22 = SFTP(SEcure File Transfer Protocol) - Upload file using SSH.
   - 80 = HTTP - Access unsecured websites.
   - 443 = HTTPS -Access secured websites.
   - 3389 = RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instances.

9. **SECURITY GROUPS HANDS-ON**

    - So first, I am going to go to EC2 dashboard.

    - On my instance created page on the left hand side i am going to click on security group.

    - Then i click on create security group.

    - Then i give it a name EC2LearningSG and description EC2 Learning Security Group then i select the VPC default.

    - Then under inbound rules i click on add rule then for type i select SSH then for source i select My IP so that only my IP can access this instance using SSH then click on create security group.

    - Then i go back to my instance page and select my instance then click on actions then security then change security groups.

    - Then i select the security group i just created EC2LearningSG then click on assign security groups.

    - EC2 instance can have many security groups attached to it. So it can attach one but two or three if you want maybe five security groups and the rules will just add on to each other. And also this security group we have created from default so for example, this launch wizard one can be attached to other EC2 instances. Okay, so you can attach as many security groups as you want as well as as many EC2 instances you want to one security group.

      +---------------------------+
      | Inbound Rules:           |
      | - SSH from My IP         |
      | - HTTP from

10. **HOW TO SSH INTO EC2 INSTANCE**

    **On Linux/Mac OS X**

    - SSH is one of the most important function. it allow you to control a remote machine, all using the command line.

    - AFter moving my downloaded .pem into a folder, So next, what I'm going to do is that I am going to go in my EC2 instance overview page and find my first instance.

    - So we're going to open a remote terminal into it. And for this, I need to get the public IPv4 address, so I can copy this, and I will use it later. The other thing I need to do is to look at the security of my instance.

    - Next, I need to try to do an SSH (open it from my file directory) on my terminal. So first of all, input ssh ec2-user@ and then the IP that i copy form my instance.

    - So the reason we do ssh ec2-user is because the Amazon Linux 2 AMI has one user already set up for us and that user is named ec2-user.

    - Then we have @ , to say that we want to access that user on the specific server. And then, we have the IP right here.

    - So we do SSH (run it) and then we're going to get a too many authentication failure or it can be warning just answer with YES. So that means that we don't authenticate into our EC2 instances.

    - we need to reference the file we just downloaded called EC2Learning.pem into our command. then next i run ssh -i EC2Learning.pem ec2-user@Public IP and run it.

    - So we will get another kind of error which is saying that we have an unprotected key file and we need to change the permissions for it.

    - And then we run another command chmod 0400 EC2Learning.pem and then run it. and i can clear my screen with (clear).

    - So next i am going to run the same command ssh -i EC2Learning.pem ec2-user@Public IP and i am logged into my machine.

    - So let's try a few commands. For example, if you do whoami then it says ec2-user or I can ping google.com and we see the google.com is responding to our pings. So we can launch some commands directly from the Amazon Linux 2 AMI, and I did control C to stop that command.

    - Now to exit the instance itself, you can either type exit/logout and I think this should work, or you do control D and then you will close the connection into the EC2 instance.

    - And if you ever want to get back into it remember this command, ssh -I EC2Learning.pem(name of my key pair)ec2-user@Public IP if you are in the correct directory.

    - Diagram:

      ```plaintext
      +---------------------------+
      |       Local Machine      |
      +---------------------------+
      | SSH Command:             |
      | ssh -i EC2Learning.pem   |
      | ec2-user@Public IP       |
      +---------------------------+
      | Connection Established   |
      +---------------------------+
      |       EC2 Instance       |
      +---------------------------+
      ```

    **WINDOWS 7/8**

    - We will configure all the required parameters necessary for doing SSH on Windows using free tool PuTTY.

    - So for this, you would go and download PuTTY. So PuTTY is a free SSH client for Windows.

    - So, we have two things here on PuTTY. We have the PuTTY app, as well as PuTTYgen. So let's first open PuTTYgen. And in case you did not download your file in the PPK format, you can actually generate the PPK format.

    - So I click on load, and then find where my file is. And i see nothing, but if I go to the bottom right, and show all files I will find my EC2Learning in the PEM format.

    - you have successfully imported this. And then you can save it as a private key. So click on save private key. And said you wanna have a pathways, you say, if you don't wanna have path, you say yes.

    - And then you save it on your desktop. So EC2Learning.PPK Now your file is saved and you have converted successfully a PEM file into the PPK format.

    - Next, we need to set up PuTTY to access our EC2 Instance. So, this time you open the PuTTY app, and here we have to enter a host name or an IP address of where we are trying to connect(IPv4).

    - And it's SSH. You're going to save this under EC2 Instance. And then you click on save, but we're not done just yet. Okay. We need to specify the key itself. So let's specify the key in here.

    - So let's specify the key in here. So, you have it saved under EC2 Instance. I double clicked. So as you can see, I have to accept this. So if we accept because we trust the host, we say, yes, accept. But we still have the login as prompt and it will not work.

    - So if I do, for example, EC2 user, it says okay, I cannot authenticate right now. So for this, we go back into PuTTY, and we're going to fix things. So click on EC2 Instance and load this profile.

    - The first thing I'm going to add is in the host name.I have to add ec2-user@Public IP, then click on save again.

    - And then for the key, we need to go into the SSH. You click the plus, you have the Auth, So you just click on Auth, and then you need to find a private key file for authentication. Click on browse, go to your desktop. And then you find the EC2Learning, that PPK file, and then select it.

    - Don't click on open just yet, go back to session, and then click on save, to save this profile. This way you don't have to redo all these steps all at once, over again. So click on open. And now it says, okay, you're authenticating using the EC2 user.

    - And so now we are into our Amazon Linux 2 AMI. So we have successfully performed the SSH using PuTTY.

    **WINDOWS 10**

    - We can use the SSH command, on Windows Power Shell or on Command Prompt and i have to be on my file directory

    - Then i run ssh -i and then enter EC2 and then press Tab and i get EC2Learning.pem suggested and if press Tab again i can get .ppk but i will use .pem on Windows 10 and then i add ec2-user@Public IP.

    - So in case you get a permission issue when running this command, what you have to do is to find your keys, so for me, it's in my desktop. You right click on your pem file, you do properties, you go to the security tab and this is where we're going to change permissions. To do so, we're going to do advanced and the first thing you need to make sure of is that the owner of this file is yourself. So it's working for me, but you can just click on change and then for object types, you can find yourself.

    - But you can just click on change and then for object types, you can find yourself, locations make sure it's on your computer and then type the object name.

    - The owner is also indicated in here, in your app permission entries. The second thing you have to do is just remove these entities, so system and administrator don't need to have access to it and we need to disable inheritance. So first let's disable inheritance, for this, we're going to remove all inherited permissions from this object. And i select add and then in here, I just select the principal and name it after myself  going to give myself full control over this.

    - So if I right click again on this file and do properties under security now, I only see myself, with full permission. and i can run the command again and i will be logged into my EC2 instance machine
