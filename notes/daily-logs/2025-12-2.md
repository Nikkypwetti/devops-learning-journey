### 📖 What I Learned

1. **S3 Overview**

   - Uses of S3 bucket
   - Detail 2

2. **S3 Hands-on**

   - So choose the region you want to create your bucket in, and we'll see that Amazon S3 still has a view over all your buckets across all regions.

   - Now there's a bucket type that you may or may not see. So if you're in some regions where it's available, you will see general purpose or directory new or more region.

   - So your bucket name must be unique across all regions and all accounts ever created in AWS.

   - So next for object ownership. Right now you have ACL disabled. This is recommended. This is a security setting.

   - Now for blocking public access to this bucket, again, we'll leave this enabled. So we'll block all public access, and we want to have maximum security in our bucket, so only us can upload files to it.

   - Next for bucket versioning. So we want to disable bucket versioning right now, and we'll see later on how to enable it.

   - And for default encryption, I'm going to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed key. So all my objects are going to be encrypted, and I will choose the first option.

   - And bucket key, I will enable it. and then created the bucket, And now it has been successfully created. And you will see here in this UI all your buckets. If you have directory enabled, you will see also directory buckets,

   - But your general purpose buckets are here. And this will deploy buckets for all AWS regions, not just the one you're in right now, but all regions.

   - So I'm going to click on it and have a look at it inside. And now in my bucket, I would like to start uploading objects because currently you have zero objects.

   - So let's click on upload, and then we can add files. And navigate into your code, go into the S3 folder, and then you will find a coffee.jpg file. then upload the files and click on close.

   - And now back into my S3 bucket. I can see the coffee.jpg file is under my objects. So I can do is now click on it and have more details around that file.

   - So now we want to open this object and see if we can open it. We can view it because we have uploaded it onto our Amazon S3 buckets. Therefore, I'm going to click on open.

   - But if I go back to my overview and click on this object url over here. So I copy it, I paste it, and I enter it. I get an access denied. And this access denied tells me that I cannot access my object using what's called the public URL.

   - So what's the difference? Well, this URL right here, if you have a look at it, the beginning is exactly the same, but then the rest is a very, very complicated and long URL, because it's called an S3 pre-signed URL. Why? Well, because this URL contains actually a signature that verifies that I am the one making the request, and therefore it has my credentials in it.

   - And so because my credentials are encoded in this URL, then Amazon S3 says, "Well,(MY OWN BUCKET NAME) is allowed to view his own object, therefore I will display it." So this public URL does not work, but this pre-signed URL with my own credentials works, and of course, this URL is only for me.

   - So we'll see how to make that object public later on, so that the public URL will function as well. So let's go back into our bucket, And I have one object, but I can create a folder.

   - And this folder name may be called images. So we scroll down and create this folder. So now I have the images folder in my bucket. I can click on it, and within it, I can upload again a file.

   - And this time, I will upload the beach.jpg file into, as you can see, the destination is my images folder within my S3 buckets. So let's upload this. Close this.

   - You know, the cloud storage service you used to know such as Google Drive or Dropbox, or whatever you want. Here, we have something very similar in terms of the user experience on Amazon S3.

   - So, of course, I can go to images and I can delete this folder entirely.
