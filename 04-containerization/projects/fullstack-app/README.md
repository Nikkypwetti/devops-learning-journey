🏗️ Part 1: The Architecture Breakdown

“I built a 3-tier containerized stack focused on Security-First principles. Instead of exposing everything, I implemented a private network topology.”

    Layer 1 (The Gateway): Nginx serves as the Reverse Proxy. It handles incoming traffic on port 80 and routes /api requests to the internal network.

    Layer 2 (The Logic): A Node.js Express API. This is completely isolated from the public internet in production.

    Layer 3 (The Data): A PostgreSQL database persisted with Docker Volumes.

🛠️ Part 2: High-Level DevOps Features

“The project isn't just about the code; it’s about the lifecycle automation.”
1. Multi-Stage Docker Builds

I used multi-stage builds to keep production images lean. We use a heavy node image for building the React assets, then discard it and copy only the final static files into a lightweight nginx:alpine image.
2. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

I developed a pipeline that:

    Authenticates with Docker Hub.

    Tags images with a Git Short-SHA for versioning.

    Pushes images to the registry only after the build succeeds.

3. Developer Experience (DX)

Using docker compose watch, I implemented Hot Reloading. When I change code in VS Code, the change syncs into the container instantly without a rebuild.
🧪 Part 3: The "Demo" Script (What to show)

Step 1: The Build

    "I manage the entire stack with a Makefile. By running make prod, Docker orchestrates the networks, volumes, and containers."

Step 2: The Security Proof

    "If I try to access the backend directly via curl localhost:5000, the connection is refused. This proves the backend is protected inside the internal Docker network. Only the Nginx proxy can talk to it."

Step 3: The UI

    "On localhost:3000, the UI displays real-time milestones fetched from the database. This proves the end-to-end data flow is healthy."

📝 Part 4: Technical Challenges Overcome

“A true engineer talks about the problems they solved.”

    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): In development, the frontend and backend live on different ports. I implemented CORS middleware in Express to allow secure communication during local testing.

    Permission Management: I handled Linux EACCES issues by correctly managing ownership (chown) of node_modules when syncing files between the host and the container.

    Reverse Proxy Routing: I configured Nginx with a specific proxy_pass to handle the transition from relative React paths to internal Docker service names.

# 🌐 Full-Stack DevOps Orchestration Lab

**Day 14 Project - DevOps Learning Journey**

# Multi-Tier Containerized Full-Stack Application

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a high-availability, 3-tier application stack (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL) architected with a "Security-First" mindset. It demonstrates the transition from local development to a production-grade automated CI/CD pipeline.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a production-ready DevOps architecture for a full-stack application. It features a React frontend, a Node.js API, and a PostgreSQL database, all orchestrated via Docker with a focus on security, scalability, and automation.

## 🏗️ Architecture Features

- **Network Isolation:** The Database and Backend are isolated in a private internal network. Only the Nginx Reverse Proxy is exposed to the public.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx handles traffic routing, ensuring the frontend can communicate with the private backend without exposing sensitive ports.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated via GitHub Actions. Every push builds, tags with Git SHA, and deploys versioned images to Docker Hub.
- **Environment Management:** Uses `.env` for credential management and Docker Compose Watch for instant hot-reloading during development.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

I implemented a **Private Network Topology** to ensure maximum security:
- **Frontend Layer:** React application served by an Nginx Reverse Proxy.
- **API Layer:** Node.js/Express service isolated from the public internet.
- **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL database persisted via Docker Volumes.

## 🌟 Key DevOps Implementations

- **Network Isolation:** Utilized Docker internal bridge networks to prevent direct public access to the database and backend API.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Built a GitHub Actions workflow to automate image testing and versioning using Git SHAs.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Integrated automated image pushes to Docker Hub for seamless deployment across environments.
- **Developer Productivity:** Configured `docker compose watch` for real-time hot-reloading, reducing the feedback loop during local coding.
- **Optimization:** Used Multi-stage Docker builds to reduce image size by ~70%, ensuring faster deployment and a smaller attack surface.

## 🛠️ Project Toolbox

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React, Nginx (Reverse Proxy) |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15 (Alpine) |
| **Orchestration** | Docker Compose |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, Docker Hub |
| **Automation** | Makefile, Bash Scripting |

## 📊 CI/CD Workflow

The .github/workflows/main.yml automates the following:

    Authenticates with Docker Hub.

    Extracts the short-sha from the Git commit.

    Builds and pushes multi-stage images with both latest and sha-unique tags.

## 🧠 Challenges Overcome

1. The Reverse Proxy Challenge

Solved complex networking issues where the React frontend was hardcoded to localhost:5000. Implemented a dynamic routing system in Nginx so the browser only ever talks to port 3000, which Nginx then proxies internally to the backend service.
2. Build Cache & Environment Sync

Encountered "phantom bugs" where old code persisted after rebuilds. Created a "Nuclear" clean command in the Makefile that prunes the Docker builder cache and recreates containers to ensure 100% environment consistency.
3. Database Persistence

Implemented Docker Volumes to ensure that learning milestones are preserved even when containers are destroyed and recreated.

**Would you like me to help you create a final "Handover Document" that explains exactly how to scale this backend from one container to three using Docker Compose's `deploy: replicas` feature?**



### 🌟 What's next?
You've built the foundation. From here, you can go even deeper:
- **Day 15-20:** You could look into **Kubernetes (K8s)**. Now that your images are on Docker Hub, you can learn how to deploy them into a cluster where they can "self-heal" if a container crashes.
- **Monitoring:** You could try adding a **Prometheus/Grafana** container to your Compose file to see real-time stats of your app's performance.
