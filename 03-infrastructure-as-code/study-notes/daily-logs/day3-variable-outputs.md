# Day 3: [Variables & Outputs]

## What I Learned

- Concept 1:

  - Define variables

Add variables blocks to your root module to let consumers pass values into the module at run time. Defining a variable block in a child module lets a parent module pass values into the child module at run time. Learn more about passing values to child modules.

- Concept 2:

  - Terraform sets up resources with hardcoded values the same way every time, making your module inflexible and potentially hard to reuse. If you know a value in your configuration changes between Terraform operations, you can replace that value with a variable block.

Defining variables gives your module consumer the flexibility to change values at run time. Add a variable block for each input you want to define for your module.

- Concept 3:

  - **Reference variable values**

To reference a variable in other parts of your configuration, use var.<NAME> syntax. For example, to make your web server use the new variables, replace the hardcoded values with references to var.instance_type, var.subnet_id, and var.environment

Module consumers can use the default values for the environment, subnet_id, and instance_type variables in the web configuration or input custom values when they run the configuration. If a variable does not have a default value, such as the subnet_id variable, then Terraform prompts the user to assign a value before it generates a plan

- Concept 4:

  - **Sensitive values in variables**

If you are defining a variable for sensitive data such as an API key or password, use the sensitive argument to prevent Terraform from displaying the value in CLI output

- Concept 5:

  - **Assign values to variables**

You can assign values to root module variables through multiple methods, each with different precedence levels. Child modules receive their inputs from a parent module as arguments. To learn more about calling child modules, refer to Modules.

If a module defines a variable without a default argument, Terraform prompts the user to supply a value for that variable before it generates a plan. You can assign variable values in the root module using the following methods:

    HCP Terraform variables and variable sets
    The -var and -var-file options on the CLI
    Variable definition files
    Environment variables

Once you assign a value to a variable, you cannot reassign that variable within the same file. However, if the root module receives multiple values for the same variable name from different sources, Terraform uses the following order of precedence:

    Any -var and -var-file options on the command line in the order provided and variables from HCP Terraform
    Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files in lexical order
    The terraform.tfvars.json file
    The terraform.tfvars file
    Environment variables
    The default argument of the variable block

Values defined in HCP Terraform and on the command line take precedence over other ways of assigning variable values. The variable's default argument is at the lowest level of precedence.

- Concept 6:

  - **Manage variables in HCP Terraform**

HCP Terraform provides the following variable management capabilities:

    Assign values to variables in your configuration through workspaces.
    Group variables into sets that you can apply to multiple workspaces.
    Use access control settings to limit who can view and create new variables.

To learn more about variables in HCP Terraform, refer to the Variables overview.
Command-line variables

Inputting variable values with Terraform CLI commands is useful for one-off deployments or when you need to override specific values without creating new files. You can assign variable values with the Terraform CLI using the -var=<VAR_NAME>=<VALUE> flag

- Concept 7:

  - **Variable definition files**

Variable definition files are ideal for managing different environment configurations and for managing variable values in your version control system. Create a variable definition file to assign multiple variable values in one file.

You can assign values directly to variable names in files with a .tfvars or .auto.tfvars extension. For example, the following file assigns variable values for a production environment:

- Terraform automatically loads variable definition files if it detects any of the following:

    File names ending in .auto.tfvars or .auto.tfvars.json
    A file named terraform.tfvars.json
    A file named terraform.tfvars

Terraform loads different variable definition files at different times, and uses the following precedence order for the values assigned in variable definition files:

    Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files in lexical order
    The terraform.tfvars.json file
    The terraform.tfvars file

If a file name ends with .json, then Terraform parses that file as a JSON object, using variable names as the root object keys:

- Concept 8:

  - **Environment variables**

Environment variables are useful in CI/CD pipelines when you want to inject configuration values without creating additional files. You can set environment variables using the TF_VAR_ prefix to a variable name:

- Concept 9:

  - **Undeclared variables**

Terraform handles setting values for undeclared variables differently depending on how you assign that value:

    Terraform ignores any assigned environment variables that do not have a matching variable block.
    Terraform warns you if you assign an undeclared variable in a variable definition file, letting you catch accidental misspellings in your configuration or definition files.
    Terraform errors if you attempt to assign a value for an undeclared variable with -var on the command line.

## Code Practice

```hcl
# Terraform code written today
*For example, if your root module has a resource with hardcoded values:*

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = "subnet-12345"

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Name        = "dev-web-server"
  }
}

*These variables lets module consumers specify custom values for customize:*

variable "instance_type" {
  type        = string
  description = "EC2 instance type for the web server"
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

variable "subnet_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "Subnet ID where the web server will be deployed"
}

variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Deployment environment name"
  default     = "dev"

  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}
*The environment variable also contains an optional validation block to ensure the value a consumer specifies as the input value meets module requirements.*

*Reference variables values*

# ...
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  subnet_id     = var.subnet_id

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Name        = "${var.environment}-web-server"
  }
}

*Sensitive variables*

variable "database_password" {
  type        = string
  description = "Password for the RDS database instance"
  sensitive   = true
}

*production.auto.tfvars file*

instance_type     = "t3.large"
environment      = "prod"
subnet_ids       = ["subnet-12345", "subnet-67890", "subnet-abcdef"]
enable_monitoring = true

*json as root object keys*

{
  "image_id": "ami-abc123",
  "availability_zone_names": ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]
}


Commands Used
bash
*Command-inline variables*

terraform apply -var="instance_type=t3.medium" -var="environment=prod"
terraform apply -var='subnet_ids=["subnet-12345","subnet-67890"]'
terraform apply -var-file="production.auto.tfvars"
*Environment variable command*
export TF_VAR_instance_type=t3.medium
export TF_VAR_environment=staging
terraform apply
*complex type*
export TF_VAR_complex_config='{"key": "value", "list": ["a", "b"]}'
